# Password Generator
First click on the Generate Password button. This will ask the user to enter\
a number between 8-128, if not it will keep asking the same alert until a\
number within that range is entered. Then it will ask the user if they want\
upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, or symbols respectively\
in their random password. The user must choose at least one of the options\
so their password can be generated. Otherwise the program will ask them to\
start over and choose one option. Once the random password is generated. The\
user has the option to Copy to Clipboard by simply pressing the button, and then\
command + V on Mac or Ctrl + V on Windows to paste anywhere they want.
